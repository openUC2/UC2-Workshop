## Experiment – 7 Smartphone Microscope


* **OPTICS**:
  * Build the “incubator microscope”/finite corrected microscope by adding the Z-stage (45 min, [UC2_05_IncubatorMic.md](UC2_05_IncubatorMic.md))
  * Swap the camera by a second mirror + eyepiece and use the cellphone as the camera




This time we want to build the smartphone microscope combined with image processing

The basic description about the device and how to align it can be found [here](../../APPLICATIONS/APP_SMARTPHONE_MICROSCOPE).

## Tasks

1. Mount a sample on the *Z-Stage*
2. Take a picture
3. Send it to ImJoy
4. Process it and see the result
