## Experiment 1 - In-Line Holographic Microscope

This experiment is an introduction into the UC2 toolbox and should give you a chance to get familiar with the core-idea of creating simple, but also complex optical setups using the modular system.

Here you are going to learn:

- assemble the cube
- add inserts
- arrange multiple cubes
- lensless imaging


## Resources

* **OLD** an earlier (2019) workshop on this matter can be found [here](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-GIT/tree/master/WORKSHOP/INLINE-HOLOGRAMM)
* **CAD** the full assembly including the description can be found in the [Assembly](https://github.com/openUC2/UC2-GIT/tree/master/APPLICATIONS/APP_INLINE_HOLOGRAM)-folder
* **SLIDES** for the introduction into holography can be found in the [PRESENTATION](./PRESENTATION/UC2_Holography.pdf)-folder


## Setup

In this course you are going to build/recreate this setup
