## Experiment â€“ 1 (Telescope)
Build your own telescope and verify magnification

This experiment is an introduction into the UC2 toolbox and should give you a chance to get familiar with the core-idea of creating simple, but also complex optical setups using the modular system.

### Steps

1. Find the proper manual for the telescope(s) on the UC2 github-page

	HINTS:

	- [TheBOX](../../TheBOX/FullBOX)
	- [CAD Applications](../../APPLICATIONS)

2. Take the box, find the components you need and assemble the telescope(s)

	HINTS:

	- Take the proper lenses for the corresponding magnification
	- Try to achieve the Keplerian and Galilean Telescope
	- Eventually exchange the components inside the cube


3. Once you have completed building one of the telescope(s), take your cellphone and measure the magnification of the telescope. This can be done with a reference object with known dimensions at a far-away distance (e.g. door, 2m and 3m away). Take a picture with and without the telescope. 

4. Measure the ratio of the magnified reference sample (magnified/non-magnified) and the orientation of the sample using Fiji on your computer. Is it the value you expected?
